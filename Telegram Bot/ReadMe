It is a Telegram Bot which we created as a freelance work.

Aim: To create a bot that can non-stop send specific messages to specific groups/channels in a regular interval of time. The messages must be sent from the users account without him touching the phone.

This Bot does following operations:

1. Validates the identity of user.
2. Sign in as users profile using telegram API's.
3. Takes info from the user such as the group names, time interval and message you want to send.
4. Checks the Authorizations to send a message and start sending it, till its instructed to stop with a simple "/stop" command.

The Folder contains different versions of bot as the bot was modified with major changes.

The bot was hosted on heroku to run non-stop.
